It includes:
- Path planning and navigation
- Real-time simulation in ROS environment
- Basic control implementation

## 🛠️ Technologies
- ROS (Robot Operating System)
- Python / C++
- Gazebo / RViz for simulation

## 🎯 Goal
To build a foundation for autonomous drone navigation and strengthen skills in ROS and robotics.
